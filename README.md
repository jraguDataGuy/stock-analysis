# An Analysis of Stock Performance based on Volume and Price
Module 2 - Rice University Data Bootcamp - VBA 
## Overview of Project
For this analysis, we are looking to review total Volume of stocks and draw conclusion of their viability in investment selection by review their return vs. volume. We previously did this exercise through guided objectives and slightly different code. We learned a process of refactoring code in order to test our original code's relative effeciency. This is a common practice in coding, as "there are many ways to skin a fish."
